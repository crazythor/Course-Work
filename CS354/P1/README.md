# Assignment 1

Contains 3 seperate C programs using arrays, command-line arguments, file I/O, pointers, and structures

###Program 1

C program called stats.c that reads integers from a binary file of integers, and computes the integer average of those integers. This program works with any input file of binary values.

###Program 2

C program called game.c that reads the integers from a binary file and builds a singly linked with them. Then, the program repetitively asks the user to guess an integer that might be in the list. The user enters a guess, and the program searches the linked list to either find the integer or not. It prints a message as to whether it found the integer or not.

###Program 3

This third program is a slightly modified version of the game program; call this program game2.c. The only difference between game and this program is the input file format. Instead of reading from a file of integers (binary), the input will be read from a file of ASCII characters.
