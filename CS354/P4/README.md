# Assignment 4

* A small C program called cache1D.c that sets each element of an array of 100,000 integers to the value of its index.
* A C program called cache2Drows.c that sets each element of a 3000 row by 500 column array of integers to the sum of the row index and the column index.
* Another C program called cache2Dcols.c that does the same thing as cache2Drows.c did, but in a different order. This program has the inner loop work its way through a single column of the array, and the outer loop iterates through the columns.
