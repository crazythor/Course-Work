For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

	0.8552

2. What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	1195
	Instruction cache references:	795802
	Data cache misses:		14995

  2.1 Calculate the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

	0.9985

  2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

	0.9799

3. What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

  3.1 Calculate the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	0.9991

  3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	0.9886

4. (to be answered without running pin)
   For this question, assume that the 100,000 elements long integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory,
   the size of an integer is 4 bytes  and the D-cache is initially empty. 
   As you READ the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, 
   how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is:
   a) 4 bytes:  40
   b) 32 bytes: 5
   c) 64 bytes: 3

5. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?

	The 64 bytes per block is better for the I-cache. It has the highest hit ratio because the larger it is the more instruction addresses it can hold.

6. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
   size affect the hit ratio for this program?
  
	The 64 bytes per block is better for the D-cache. The Data is stored in the D-cache and so it needs to be large for it to hold as much data as it can.  The larger the block size the more data can be held in the D-cache which results in a higher hit ratio.

	Instruction cache misses:	691
	Instruction cache references:	18122823

	Data cache references:		13567607

  7.1 Calculate the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

8. What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	691
	Instruction cache references:	18100323
	Data cache misses:		1513662
	Data cache references:		13550107

  8.1 Calculate the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	0.9999

  8.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

	0.8883

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

9. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 7 and 8.
   Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".

	There is almost no difference in the hit ratios for the I-cache of both programs because both programs are caching instructions nearby the current instruction or have a high degree of spacial locality which results in both I-caches having similar performances.

10. (to be answered without running pin) 
    For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory,
    the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty.
    As you READ the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0],
    how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of:
    a) cache2Drows: 1
    b) cache2Dcols: 10

11. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 7 and 8.
    Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".

	When it comes to comparing the D-cache there is a difference in performance of the 2 programs, the hit ratio of cache2Drows is higher than cache2Dcols.  This result is because of the spatial locality in the caches. For the cache2Drows array the next element will be in the same row, which will likely be caches since they are nearby elements. However in cache2Dcols array the next element will be in the same column but an entire row apart wich will lead to a higher miss ratio.
