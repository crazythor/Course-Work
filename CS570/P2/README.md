# Project 2

Final prototype can be found at: [SyNERGY 2.0 Mobile App](https://invis.io/5N6UXQTFZ#/149314525_Menu)

In this second project we were tasked with finding a problem area in everyday life that can be solved with a mobile application. The problem area we decided to develop for was the issue of trying to easily split bills with friends. All too often we found ourselves in the situation where not everyone has Venmo or the same mobile payment method and definitely not everyone has enough cash on them, so why not make an easy to use mobile app to handle all of that. The idea is pretty simple, ideally one user would take a picture of the receipt and then the app would read the receipt, dividing up each item. The host can then invite his friends who bought things with him to the bill so they can each select things they bought. Once all items are divided up and tip/tax is added if necessary, user will be able to select which mobile payment service they prefer and pay the host via that. It is clean, quick and simple. Much better than hassling Jonny for that $15 he owes you from last week.

### Interim Presentation
The interim presentations will involve giving a general idea of our problem space, whom we have interviewed, what our findings are, and what are some preliminary design ideas that we might pursue.

### Reports
**CogTool Report**
A four-page report describing the process we went through when describing which design processes would be the best for interaction with the user. We talk about 2 main design features and the process users have to go through to use the features as well as how long it takes them to create a better application that is easier to use.
**Probe Report**
A four-page report describing the process we took when interviewing and finding informationa about our applicaiton. It goes into detail about the decisions we made, our findings, and our reflections.

### CogTool
Used a tool known as CogTool to help us sketch a scenario of use for a designed interface and build keystroke-level models and calculate predicted task completion times automatically.

### Diary Study
**Data**   
For roughly a week we tracked the spending habbits of 3 people, to find out common places they would need to split bills, what mobile services their friends use, how they are currently splitting bills and what frustrations they have with it. Then neatly laid out all our findings into an excel document.   
**Snapshot**   
A screen shot of what the user filled out after purchasing items with other people. We decided to use a google form to try and make it as easy and painless as possible for them.

### Work Models
**Flow** : Direction of communication and coordination   
**Physical** : Layout of the work environment

### Affinity Diagram
Affinity Diagrams are generated during group session, organizes ideas into a hierarchy. Each observation/idea/note are hierarchically organized into themes, based on the focus of the project, built bottom-up. Put up notes from brainstorm, one by one.

### Final Presentation
A two minute long self run power point describing our final design and demonstrating the key tasks our mobile application supports.
