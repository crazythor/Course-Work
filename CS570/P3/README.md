# Project 3

Final project video can be found at: [Final Video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/peauvub6oo7lhbw/CLEANOMATIC%203000.mp4?dl=0)

For this project we were tasked to look into the future and find an environment that could utilize a robot to make a process
easier. We chose bars as our setting, with the specific activity to study being the bartending process. We wanted to create a 
robot that could make the everyday tasks of a bartender much easier, faster and safer. 

### Work Models
**Flow** : Direction of communication and coordination   
**Physical** : Layout of the work environment

### Affinity Diagram
Affinity Diagrams are generated during group session, organizes ideas into a hierarchy. Each observation/idea/note are 
hierarchically organized into themes, based on the focus of the project, built bottom-up. Put up notes from brainstorm, 
one by one.

### Pictures
A combination of pictures taken during our ethnography displaying bartenders and bar-backs at work that directly relate to
our findings in the field.

### Ethnography Report
This outlines in detail our direct finding from our ethnography. Talks about direct uses of our robot and where it would fit
in best, what bars would it work in best, interviews with bartenders, and finally pin-pointing final design ideas for our robot.

### Transcripts
Complete transcripts of all the interviews we conducted as well as annotaions representing the good and bad aspects of the
bartenders current experience. It also outlines specific personas and events we noticed happen while conducting our ethnography.

### Process Book
This describes our complete research process from ideation to evaluation. Include descriptions of every step of our research
process and supporting figures such as models from our user research, pictures from our user evaluations, and sketches and 
screenshots from your prototypes. This is a general wrap-up of all our work during this project.
