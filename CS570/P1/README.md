# Project 1

Final prototype can be found at: [Student Center](https://invis.io/VU66VKA3B)

In the first project we were tasked with finding a web-service that need significant development and improvement. My group decided to work on the UW Madison Student Center where all UW students have to go to sign up for classes, check their schedule, pay tuition, as well as many other things. Our main goal was to improve the search functionality so it is easier for students to find classes they need, as of now they have to use 2 separate services to find classes and display their schedule. As you can see in our high fidelity prototype we have combined all of these into one easy to use experience. 

### Interim Presentation

The interim presentations will involve giving a general idea of our problem space, whom we have interviewed, what our findings are, and what are some preliminary design ideas that we might pursue.

### Report

A four-page report in PDF format of your process describing the decisions you made, your findings, your reflections.

### Snapshots

Representative snapshots from your videos during our contextual inquiries.

### Transcripts

Complete transcripts of all three of our contextual inquiries we did as well as annotaions representing the good and bad aspects of Student Center.

### Work Models

***Flow*** : Direction of communication and coordination   
***Sequence*** : Detailed sequence of work steps   
***Artifact*** : Physical objects that support the work   
***Culture*** : External influences   
***Physical*** : Layout of the work environment

### Affinity Diagram

Affinity Diagrams are generated during group session, organizes ideas into a hierarchy. Each observation/idea/note are hierarchically organized into themes, based on the focus of the project, built bottom-up. Put up notes from brainstorm, one by one.

### Progress Book

This describes our complete research process from ideation to evaluation. Include descriptions of every step of our research process and supporting figures such as models from our user research, pictures from our user evaluations, and sketches and screenshots from your prototypes. This is a general wrap-up of all our work during this project.

### Final Presentation

Describing our design and demonstrating the key tasks our design supports.
