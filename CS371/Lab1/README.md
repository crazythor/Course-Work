### Exercise 1: Yield on Taxable versus Tax-Free Investments

***Finance Concept:*** While making the decision between a tax free or taxable investment, one needs to know the rate at which the same yield can be obtained after taxes.

***Function:*** A program that prompts the user to enter the Rate of Tax-free Yield
and displays the Taxable equivalent yield. Assume the user’s tax rate is 31%.

### Exercise 2: Tough Evaluations

***Management Concept:*** Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, demanded that executives grade managers as A, B, or C players. ‘A’ players got bonuses and stock options. C players were at risk. Every year, executives are asked to fire the bottom 10 percent of all managers. Welch made performance evaluation a comprehensive process. Managers were evaluated on both results and culture. Culture includes how managers treat and develop their people and upheld the company's values. If managers did not do well on both results and culture, they were out. While the A managers demonstrated the four e's: energy, energize, edge (toughness), execute, the C rated managers enervated others. According to Welch, it wasn't cruel to fire them; it would be cruel to others to keep them around.

***Function:*** A program that prompts the user to enter the manager’s name, results
score and culture score for n number of managers (n is taken as an input). Afterwards, display all the managers’ name, rating and reward in appropriate manner.

### Exercise 3: Mortgage Calculator

***Mortgage Concept:*** Johnson Bank offers mortgages that can be repaid in 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years. The Bank staff decides to use a software application to calculate the monthly payment for different mortgage lengths and seek the help of Sylvan Software Company. Sylvan assigns you to develop a pilot application.

***Function:*** An application that allows a user to enter the price of a house (the
amount of the mortgage) and the annual interest rate. When the user clicks a Button, the application displays a table of mortgage length in years (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) together with the monthly payment as shown in the example below.

### Exercise 4: Wage Calculator

***Wage Calculator Concept:*** The UW Business School employs many student workers on an hourly basis. The Business school has decided to create a software application which takes in the start time and end time of work for a particular student and outputs the total hours for a particular week and the weekly pay depending upon the hourly wage for the employee. The Dean has asked you to create a pilot application.

***Function:*** An application that takes in start time and end time of work for various days
of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday), an hourly wage and the employee’s name. The application should display the Employee Name, Total Number of hours worked during the week and Weekly Pay.

### Exercise 5: Calculating Depreciation of an Asset

***Depreciation and Salvage Value Concept:*** Most equipment that companies use such as machinery, trucks and computers are productive only for a certain amount of time. Near the end of the lifespan of these products, they are salvaged and disposed of for a fraction of the initial purchase price. Accountants require a period-by-period matching of costs against income. Hence, the cost of a fixed asset (over and above its salvage value) is distributed over the asset’s estimated lifetime.

***Straight Line Method:*** The default method used to gradually reduce the carrying amount of a fixed asset over its useful life. The method is designed to reflect the consumption pattern of the underlying asset, and is used when there is no particular pattern to the manner in which the asset is to be used over time. Use of the straight-line method is highly recommended, since it is the easiest depreciation method to calculate, and so results in few calculation errors.

***The Sum of The Years' Digits Method:*** Used to accelerate the recognition of depreciation. Doing so means that most of the depreciation associated with an asset is recognized in the first few years of its useful life. The method is more appropriate than the more commonly-used straight-line depreciation if an asset depreciates more quickly or has greater production ca­pacity in the earlier years than it does as it ages. The total amount of depreciation is identical no matter which depreciation method is used - the choice of depreciation method only alters the timing of depreciation recognition.
