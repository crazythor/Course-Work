For our final project we were tasked to form a consulting team to convince Ford Motor Company that they should adopt a new
parts managment system for their dealerships so they can handle inventory and make new part orders. Not only did we design and
program an easy to use Windows application for the dealerships, but we also had to consider all factors in why Ford should adopt 
our program over others and then pitch our idea to For representatives. 

### Overview

Currently all 4200 Ford dealerships nationwide are using the Covisint system as their main business to business communication 
program for managing and ordering new automotive parts. This however creates several intermediate data authentications the 
dealership must go through making it a clumsy and hard system to use. Our goal is to provide a national information system 
that manages and communicates part information to organizations and downstream systems at Ford Motor Company. This will ensure 
that each dealership will be able to easily view their entire inventory as well as make and track new orders. Giving the 
dealerships live updates and more transparency to Ford Motor Companyâ€™s parts system allows them to maintain a smaller 
inventory and order parts on an as need basis.

### Charter

A detailed report outlining our strategic strategy and plan of action for implementing our new parts managment system. In this
document you will find an estimated timeline of launch, expected deliverables, overview of financial spending, employees needed, 
as well as any potential risks faced during implementation.

### Financial Spreadsheet

A 5 year overview of the projected cost of the project. This includes cost of servers and maintenance, salaries of development team, 
return on investment, as well as much more detailed cost analysis.

### Case Presentation

The slide deck we used to pitch our idea to Ford representatives.

### Pilot Application

A working beta version of our parts managment system described above, written in VB.net.

***Please note the application uses University of Wisconsin databases and will only work when on the university's network***
