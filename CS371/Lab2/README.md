# Lab 2

### Exercise 1: Point of Sale System

Created an e-commerce sporting goods store where customers could create an account and log in. Once logged in they would be able to purchase sports equipment and select the quantity they wanted. After the customer is done shopping the point of sale system will add up subtotal, tax and total and display the final receipt to the customer.

### Exercise 2: Dane County Airport

Created the boards you see in an airport to display the arriving and departing times and statuses of Dane County's airplanes. The program has 3 windows; one to display the arriving flights, one to display the departing flights, and finally another one for the user to add flights to the boards. Each flight will contain useful information about the flight like: airline, gate number, arriving/departing time, and status.
