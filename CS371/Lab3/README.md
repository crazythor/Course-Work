# Lab 3

**Note: All programs in the lab use UW Madison databases that can only be accessed while on campus**

### Exercise 1: Database Queries

Managing and creating database quaries so that the manager of a store can easily see detailed information about his store.
**Customer** form will display a list of the information for the most important customers. **Employee** form will let your
accountant know the name, address, payroll and if any of your employee's are on commission. **Suppliers** form will display only
the supliers who are in the United States for the "Made in USA" sale. **Items** form will list which items need to be reordered; that is when the quantity on hand matches
the reorder point for the item.

### Exercise 2: Instant-access ATM Application

The ATM application allows users to log in to an account by selecting their account number and providing a valid corresponding PIN. Once logged in, the user can view the account balance and withdraw 
money from the account (if the account contains sufficient funds). If money is withdrawn, the application updates the database with the new correct balance.

### Exercise 3: Rental Property Management

Created a program that used multiple databases containing rental property information. The application makes it easier to track occupancy rates, view rent collection and manage properties.
The user is able to search through the database of all current properties with a search bar, when they hit search it will update the display to 
show only listings that match the users search. When selecting a certain property the user will be able to see all specific information about
the property as well as update anything that needs it. The manager can also see what rent has been paid and will alert them if a user has an over due rental payment.
